### About this Project

In this project , we will uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company ,HealthStat.We will analyze attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences and make recommendations based on the findings. </br>

**The key findings are as follows:**</br>

1.The average length of stay (LOS) is 2.65 days.</br>
2.The average cost per discharge is $21,000.</br>
3.Key factors increasing the average LOS include patient disposition, health service area, and risk of mortality.</br>
4.The average LOS is likely to increase if patients are discharged to a skilled nursing home, if the health service area is New York City, and if the risk of mortality is extreme or major.</br>
5.The top factors influencing an increase in the average cost per discharge are the severity of illness, risk of mortality, and health service area.</br>
6.Notable outliers with very high average LOS or very high cost per discharge (or both) are:</br>
  - NYU Lutheran Medical Center in New York City: Average LOS of 2.61 days and average cost per discharge of $84,601.</br>
  - Olean General Hospital in Western NY: Average LOS of 2.55 days and average cost per discharge of $81,265.</br>
  - Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases in New York City: Average LOS of 9.10 days and average cost per discharge of $64,236.</br>
  - Kings County Hospital Center in New York City: Average LOS of 12 days and average cost per discharge of $60,361.</br>
  - Interfaith Medical Center in New York City: Average LOS of 9.33 days and average cost per discharge of $52,926.</br>
  - NewYork-Presbyterian/Hudson Valley Hospital in Hudson Valley: Average LOS of 3.21 days and average cost per discharge of $54,719.

**Based on the findings, here are some recommendations:**


Specialized Care Units:

  - Set up special care units with trained staff for very sick patients to ensure they get the right care without staying too long in the hospital.

Better Coordination:

  - Improve the communication and coordination between hospitals and nursing homes to make patient transfers smoother and faster.

Cost Reduction:

  - Look at what causes high costs at hospitals and find ways to save money, like using medical supplies more efficiently and making operations smoother.
  - Think about using care models that reward cost-effective treatments while still providing high-quality care.

Address Outliers:

  - Review cases at hospitals with high LOS and discharge costs to understand why this is happening.
  - Create action plans to fix issues, such as improving care procedures, using resources better, and learning from hospitals with lower LOS and costs.

Predictive Analytics:

  - Use data tools to find patients who might stay longer or cost more early in their hospital stay. This helps manage their care better from the start.
  - Keep track of performance and results to see how well strategies are working and make changes based on data.

By focusing on these areas, hospitals can reduce how long patients stay and how much it costs for each discharge, improving patient care and efficiency.
